=== Introduction

The CNP metadata specification conforms to the S-100 metadata specification
in Part 4a, which is a profile of the <<ISO_19115_1_2018>> Standard.
These documents provide a structure for describing digital geographic
data and define metadata elements, a common set of metadata terminology,
definitions, and extension procedures.

[[sec_12.2]]
=== Discovery metadata

The overall structure of metadata in S-128 Exchange Sets is the same
as in S-100, and is depicted in <<fig_12-1>> below. Metadata in Exchange
Sets consists of discovery metadata for the datasets and support files
in the Exchange Set (classes S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata and
S100_SupportFileDiscoveryMetadata); metadata in <<ISO_19115_1_2018>>
format for datasets; and metadata about any Feature, Portrayal, or
Interoperability Catalogues which are in the Exchange Set (S100_CatalogueMetadata).

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which enable
important information about the datasets and accompanying support
files to be examined without the need to process the data, for example
decrypt, decompress, load, etc. Other Catalogues such as Feature and
Portrayal Catalogues can be included in the Exchange Set in support
of the datasets.

More detailed information for the classes is depicted in <<fig_12-2>>
and details about the metadata classes are provided in clauses 12.2 - 12.5.

.Relationship between Exchange Catalogue, discovery metadata, and dataset (from S-100 Edition 5.2.0, Figure 17-6)
image::figure-12-1.png["",527,350]

The detailed structure of the S-128 Exchange Catalogue is depicted
in <<fig_12-2>>. This figure is derived from S-100 Edition 5.2.0,
Part 17, Figure 17-7 with the following restriction:

* Elements that are optional in the generic S-100 Catalogue model
but not used in S-128 are not shown; for example, the <<ISO_8211>>
and HDF5 formats in S100_EncodingFormat.

[[fig_12-2]]
.Details of Exchange Set Catalogue classes. (Derived from S-100 Edition 5.2.0, Figure 17-7)
image::figure-12-2.jpg["",660,436]

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata needed
for S-128. In some cases the metadata may be repeated in a national
language. If this is the case it is noted in the Remarks column.

In the following clauses, wherever S-128 makes an optional S-100 metadata
attribute mandatory (that is, restricts multiplicity from 0.. to 1..),
the restricted multiplicity is shown in place of the multiplicity
given in S-100 Part 17. When this is done, the Remarks column contains
a note about the restriction. Further, enumerations in the Figure
and the following clauses show only the values allowed in S-128 Exchange
Catalogues.

For Product Specifications to be used in S-100 ECDIS, covered by S-98,
a third principle is that the S-100 Exchange Catalogue profile cannot
be extended at the Product Specification level. This principle exists
so that implementers of the S-100 Exchange Catalogue profile are not
required to consider product specific extensions.

==== S100_ExchangeCatalogue

Each exchange set has a single S100_ExchangeCatalogue which contains
meta information for the data and support files in the Exchange Set.
