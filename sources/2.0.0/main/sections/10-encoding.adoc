== Data Product Format (Encoding)

[[sec_10.1]]
=== Introduction

The principal encoding will be the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC),
Geography Markup Language (GML) format. GML is an XML grammar designed
to express geographical features. It serves as a modelling language
for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for geographic
transactions.

*Format Name:*::   GML
*Version:*::       3.2.1
*Character Set:*:: UTF-8
*Specification:*:: https://www.ogc.org/[https://www.ogc.org]

=== Coordinate encoding in spatial primitives

Values of latitude and longitude must not be more accurate than 7
decimal places. Coordinates must be encoded as decimals in the format
described in <<sec_10.2.1>>.

Geometry may be encoded either inline or by reference to a spatial
primitives located elsewhere in the dataset that encodes the actual
coordinate values. The GML conventions for references and axis order
must be followed. The CRS shall be identified using the URI convention
for SRS specified by OGC, which is http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
(S-100 Part 10b). The axis order is latitude/longitude.

[[sec_10.2.1]]
==== Encoding of coordinates as decimals

Values should be coded as decimal numbers with 7 or fewer digits after
the decimal. The normative encoding is in degrees, with an accuracy
of stem:[10^{-7}] degrees; that is, 7 digits after the decimal point.

The decimal point must be indicated by the "." character.

Trailing zeroes after the decimal point (and the decimal point itself
if appropriate) may be omitted at producer discretion, but the accuracy
must still be as indicated (for example, stem:[10^{-7}] degrees for
coordinates of default accuracy).

=== Numeric attribute encoding

Floating point and integer attribute values must not contain leading
zeros. Floating point attribute values must not contain non-significant
trailing zeros.

[[sec_10.4]]
=== Text attribute values

Character strings must be encoded using the character set defined
in <<ISO_10646_1>>, in Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8).

[[sec_10.5]]
=== Mandatory attribute values

There are four reasons why attribute values may be considered mandatory:

* They determine whether a feature is in the display base.
* Certain features make no logical sense without specific attributes.
* Some attributes are necessary to determine which symbol is to be
displayed.
* Some attributes are required for safety of navigation.

All mandatory attributes are identified in the Feature Catalogue and
summarized in Annex A -- Data Classification and Encoding Guide.

[[sec_10.6]]
=== Data overlap

S-128 datasets can overlap other S-128 datasets.

[[sec_10.7]]
=== Data extent

Datasets must not cross the stem:[180 "unitsml(deg)"] meridian of
longitude.
