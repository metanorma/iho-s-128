== Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

[[sec_5.1]]
=== Introduction

The location of an object in the S-100 Standard is defined by means
of coordinates which relate a feature to a position. The coordinate
reference system used for this Product Specification is World Geodetic
System 1984 (WGS 84) which is defined by the European Petroleum Survey
Group (EPSG) code 4326, (or similar - North American Datum 1983 /
Canadian Spatial Reference System).

Spatial data is expressed as latitude (stem:[phi]) and longitude (stem:[lambda])
geographic coordinates. Latitude values are stored as a negative number
to represent a position south of the Equator. Longitude values are
stored as a negative number to represent a position west of the International
Prime Meridian. Coordinates are expressed as real value, degree /
degree decimal format. Datasets conforming to this product specification
are not projected.

*Horizontal coordinate reference system:*:: WGS84

*Projection:*:: None

*Vertical coordinate reference system:*:: Although all coordinates
in a data set must refer to the same horizontal CRS different Vertical
Datums can be used for the depth component of a coordinate tuple.
Therefore the vertical CRS can be repeated. For each Vertical CRS
a unique identifier is defined. Those identifiers will be used to
indicate which Vertical CRS is used. Units must be in meters.

*Temporal reference system:*:: Gregorian calendar

*Coordinate reference system registry:*:: http://www.epsg-registry.org/[EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry]

*Date type (according to <<ISO_19115>>):*:: 002 - publication

*Responsible party:*:: International Organisation of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP)

=== Horizontal reference system

Positional data is expressed in latitude and longitude geographic
coordinates to one of the reference horizontal reference systems defined
in the horizontalDatum attribute. Unless otherwise defined, the World
Geodetic System 84 (WGS 84) will be used for CNP data products.

=== Projection

CNP data products are un-projected.

=== Vertical coordinate reference system

Although all coordinates in a data set must refer to the same horizontal
CRS different Vertical Datums can be used for the depth component
of a coordinate tuple. Therefore the vertical CRS can be repeated.
For each Vertical CRS a unique identifier is defined. Those identifiers
will be used to indicate which Vertical CRS is used. Units must be
in meters.

=== Temporal reference system

Time is measured by reference to Calendar dates and Clock time in
accordance with <<ISO_19108_2002>> Temporal Schema, clause 5.4.4.

=== Coverage of nautical products data and scale

CNP data must be compiled in the best applicable scale. The use of
the data itself is "scale independent". That means that the data can
be used at any scale. S-100 allows the association of multiple spatial
attributes to a single feature instance. Each of these spatial attributes
can in principle be qualified by maximum and minimum scales.

For example, it is possible, within one dataset, to have a single
instance of a feature that has more than one area geometry. Each of
these geometries has different scale max/min attributes. Moreover,
due to cluttering in smaller scales, the scale minimum attribute may
be used to turn off portrayal of some features at smaller scales.
