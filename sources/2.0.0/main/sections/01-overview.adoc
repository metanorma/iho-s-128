=== Introduction

This document has been produced by the IHO Nautical Information Provision
Working Group (NIPWG) in response to a requirement to produce a data
product that can be used as a Nautical Publication Information Overlay
(NPIO) within an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS).
It is based on the IHO S-100 framework Specification and the ISO 19100
series of standards. It is a vector Product Specification that is
primarily intended for encoding the content of Catalogues of Nautical
Products, for navigational purposes.

Catalogue of Nautical Products (CNP) datasets describe the availability
of paper charts, ENCs and other nautical products, applications for
navigational purposes, online services and e-Navigation services.
This includes their issue date, status, producing agency, and coverage.

==== Use of Language

Within this document:

* "Must" indicates a mandatory requirement.
* "Should" indicates an optional requirement, that is the recommended
process to be followed, but is not mandatory.
* "May" means "allowed to" or "could possibly", and is not mandatory.

[[sec_1.3.2]]
[heading="Terms and definitions"]
==== Terms and definitions

The S-100 framework is based on the ISO 19100 series of geographic
standards. The terms and definitions provided here are used to standardize
the nomenclature found within that framework, whenever possible.
They are taken from the references cited in <<sec_1.2>>. Modifications
have been made when necessary.

===== Application

Manipulation and processing of data in support of user requirements.

.[source]
<<ISO_19101>>

===== Application Schema

Conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications.

.[source]
<<ISO_19101>>

===== Conceptual Model

Model that defines concepts of a universe of discourse.

.[source]
<<ISO_19101>>

===== Conceptual Schema

Formal description of a conceptual model.

.[source]
<<ISO_19101>>

===== Coverage

{{Feature}} that acts as a function to return values from its range
for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal
{{Domain}}.

[.source]
<<ISO_19123>>

[example]
Raster image, polygon overlay, digital elevation matrix.

===== Data Product

{{Dataset}} or {{Dataset Series}} that conforms to a
{{Data Product Specification}}.

===== Data Product Specification

Detailed description of a {{Dataset}} or {{Dataset Series}} together
with additional information that will enable it to be created, supplied
to, and used by another party.

NOTE: A data Product Specification provides a description of the universe
of discourse and a specification for mapping the universe of discourse
to a dataset. It may be used for production, sales, end-use, or other
purpose.

===== Dataset

Identifiable collection of data.

[.source]
<<ISO_19115>>

NOTE: A dataset may be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited
by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located
physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset may be
as small as a single feature or feature attribute contained within
a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart may be considered a dataset.

===== Dataset Series

Collection of {{Dataset,datasets}} sharing common characteristics.

[.source]
<<ISO_19115>>

===== Domain

Well-defined set.

[.source]
<<ISO_TS_19103_2005>>

NOTE: Well-defined means that the definition is both necessary and
sufficient, as everything that satisfies the definition is in the
set and everything that does not satisfy the definition is necessarily
outside the set.

===== Feature

Abstraction of real world phenomena.

.[source]
<<ISO_19101>>

NOTE: A feature can occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or
feature instance will be used when only one is meant.

===== Feature Association

Relationship that links instances of one {{Feature}} type with instances
of the same or a different {{Feature}} type.

[.source]
<<ISO_19110_2005>>

===== Feature Attribute

Characteristic of a {{Feature}}.

[.source]
<<ISO_19101_1_2014,clause=4.1.12>>

[example]
A feature attribute named "colour" can have an attribute value "green"
which belongs to the data type "text".

[example]
A feature attribute named length can have an attribute value "82.4"
which belongs to the data type "real".

NOTE: A feature attribute has a type name, a data type and a value
domain associated to it. A feature attribute for a feature instance
also has an attribute value taken from the value domain.

NOTE: In a Feature Catalogue a feature attribute can include a value
domain but does not specify attribute values for feature instance.

NOTE: In UML, attribute associations and operations are representation
types and are not fundamental to the type of a characteristic nor
to the type of feature. All three are equally capable of representing
the same characteristics of a feature. Every implementation of a characteristic
is allowed to use the representation type that is most appropriate
and can use several different representations for a single characteristic
if required.

Feature associations and feature operations therefore are different
types of feature attribute, the distinction between them being based
on storage and access mechanism rather than semantics.

===== Geographic Data

Data with implicit or explicit reference to a location relative to
the Earth.

[.source]
<<ISO_19109>>

NOTE: Geographic information is also used as a term for information
concerning phenomena implicitly or explicitly associated with a location
relative to the Earth.

===== Metadata

Information about a resource.

[.source]
<<ISO_19115_1_2014,clause=4.10>>

===== Model

Abstraction of some aspects of reality.

[.source]
<<ISO_19109>>

===== Portrayal

Presentation of information to humans.

NOTE: Within the scope of this International Standard Portrayal is
restricted to the portrayal of geographic information".

[.source]
<<ISO_19117_2012,clause=4.20>>

===== Quality

Totality of characteristics of a product that bear on its ability
to satisfy stated and implied needs.

.[source]
<<ISO_19101>>

===== Universe of Discourse

View of the real or hypothetical world that includes everything of
interest.

.[source]
<<ISO_19101>>

=== General S-128 data product description

NOTE: This clause contains general information about the data product

*Title:*:: Catalogue of Nautical Products Product Specification

*Abstract:*:: Catalogue of Nautical Products (CNP) datasets describe
the availability and reliability of paper chart, ENC, S-100 based
nautical products, application for navigational purpose, online service
and e-Navigation services. This includes their issue date, publication
status, producing agency, and source indication. CNP is intended to
exchange status of nautical products and to be a supplement to ENC,
and therefore does not describe the geographic information in detail
equal to ENC, rather it is shown as a coverage of nautical products.

*Content:*:: Datasets conforming to this Specification will contain
Catalogues of some of relevant nautical products information for the
area of coverage such as paper chart, ENC, Nautical Publication, S-100
based nautical products and e- Navigation service.

*Spatial Extent:*

*Description:*:: Global coverage of maritime areas.

*East Bounding Longitude:*:: 180°

*West Bounding Longitude:*:: -180°

*North Bounding Latitude:*:: 90°

*South Bounding Latitude:*:: -90°

*Purpose:*:: Describing status of nautical products, and to allow
the producer to exchange catalogue of nautical products with interested
stakeholders.

=== IHO Product Specification maintenance

[[sec_1.6.1]]
==== Introduction

Changes to S-128 will be released by the IHO as a new edition, revision,
or clarification.

[[sec_1.6.2]]
==== New Edition

New Editionsof S-128 introduce significant changes. _New Editions_
enable new concepts, such as the ability to support new functions
or applications, or the introduction of new constructs or data types.
_New Editions_ are likely to have a significant impact on either existing
users or future users of S-10n.

[[sec_1.6.3]]
==== Revision

_Revisions_ are defined as substantive semantic changes to S-128.
Typically, revisions will change S-128 to correct factual errors;
introduce necessary changes that have become evident as a result of
practical experience or changing circumstances. A _revision_ must
not be classified as a clarification. _Revisions_ could have an impact
on either existing users or future users of S-128. All cumulative
_clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved corrections
revisions.

Changes in a revision are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions,
for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same
Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a
later version of the feature and portrayal catalogues.

In most cases a new feature or portrayal catalogue will result in
a revision of S-128.

[[sec_1.6.4]]
==== Clarification

Clarifications are non-substantive changes to S-128. Typically, clarifications:
remove ambiguity; correct grammatical and spelling errors; amend or
update cross references; insert improved graphics in spelling, punctuation
and grammar. A clarification must not cause any substantive semantic
change to S-128.

Changes in a clarification are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition. Within the same
Edition, a dataset of one clarification version could always be processed
with a later version of the feature and portrayal catalogues, and
a Portrayal Catalogue can always rely on earlier versions of the Feature
Catalogues.

[[sec_1.6.5]]
==== Version numbers

The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n) to
S-128 must be as follows:

New Editions denoted as *n*.0.0

Revisions denoted as n.*n*.0

Clarifications denoted as n.n.*n*
