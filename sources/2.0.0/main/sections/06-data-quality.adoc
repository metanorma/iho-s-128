== Data Quality

[[sec_6.1]]
=== Introduction

Data quality allows users and user systems to assess fitness for use
of the provided data. Data quality measures and the associated evaluation
are reported as metadata of a data product. This metadata improves
interoperability with other data products and provides usage by user
groups that the data product was not originally intended for.
The secondary users can make assessments of the data product usefulness
in their application based on the reported data quality measures.

For S-128 the following data quality elements have been included:

* Conformance to this Product Specification;
* Intended purpose of the data product;
* Completeness of the data product in terms of coverage;
* Logical Consistency;
* Positional uncertainty and accuracy;
* Thematic accuracy;
* Temporal quality;
* Aggregation measures;
* Elements specifically required for the data product
(none currently identified for S-128);
* Validation checks or conformance checks including:
** General tests for dataset integrity;
** Specific tests for a specific data model.
